Material for the Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations exercise in the Protein Science course.


# File structure

The two folders contain the same simulation runs, but with different atom selections:

1) Insulin\_w\_solvent: included protein + solvent
	- Insulin is centered in the middle of the simulation box

2) Insulin: only the protein

	- Insulin is centered in the middle of the simulation box, and its rotational and translational motions have been removed

There are two sets of simulations:

1) INS1

	- coordinate file: INS1.pdb

	- trajectory file: INS1.xtc

2) INS2

	- coordinate file: INS2.pdb
	
	- trajectory file: INS2.pdb
